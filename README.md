# domlock

domlock is a poorly-named experiment in DOM rendering with [Havelock](https://github.com/ds300/havelock)

It is similar in approach to React et al, but shifts the burden of immutability to the state layer, where it makes most sense.

## project goals:

- work with the DOM, not against it.
- be as simple as possible.


## non goals

- be as concise as possible
